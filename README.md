# FTP client in C

## Definition :
> The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files 
>from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a clientâ€“server model architecture using 
>separate control and data connections between the client and the server.[1] FTP users may authenticate 
>themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can 
>connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password,
>and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
